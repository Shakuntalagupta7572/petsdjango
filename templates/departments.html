      <p>Pet wellness is about the mental, physical, and emotional care of a pet. Pet wellness exams are preventative
        and can include vaccinations, parasite prevention, and nutritional counseling. During a wellness exam, a
        veterinarian can also assess a pet's eyes, ears, teeth, gums, abdomen, skin health, and listen to their heart
        and lungs.

                  proper skin care for your pet.
